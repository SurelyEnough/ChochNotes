        <h2>Trauma</h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          The main theme of <i>Strangers</i> - the effects of trauma, especially
          on young people - is expressed through the story’s protagonist, Cole
          Harper. Cole is a young adult whose past is marked by death and guilt
          arising from a fire that burned through a school in his Indigenous
          settlement, Wounded Sky. He is a protagonist whom David A. Robertson
          suggests is a hero because of his courage and determination to do
          justice to his past and reunite his community, despite his
          vulnerabilities about his trauma. It is easy to see that Cole’s
          greatest challenge is his trauma surrounding his community, whom he
          has panic attacks because of. In seeing Cole reunite his community and
          overcome his trauma through solving new problems and interacting with
          figures arising from his trauma - Jayne, Alex, and his friends -
          Robertson is suggesting that trauma is a challenge that can be
          overcome and reckoned with. Despite this, Cole’s challenges with his
          trauma continue throughout the book and will most likely be concluded
          at the end of the series. In <i>Strangers</i>, however, it is evident
          that Cole is coming to terms with his challenges with trauma. By
          showing Cole’s progression, the novel shows that overcoming trauma is
          a process that requires reuniting and deliberate action, as we see in
          Cole.
        </p>
        <h2>Heroism</h2>
        <p>
          In literature, a hero traditionally has been considered to be someone
          possessing great courage or strength. Yet, in <i>Strangers</i>, these
          qualities are hard to describe in Cole Harper. Cole is an
          untraditional hero whose moral courage, love for his community, and
          desire to help the greater good, all make him a hero, Robertson
          suggests. In other words, the heroism of Cole Harper lies not in his
          concrete actions, but in his love and character. Cole’s decision to
          keep going even after being harassed by his critics shows his
          determination and resilience, a quality not often seen in heroes as
          heroes are generally well perceived by the public. In showing that
          Cole is disliked by many, the novel comments on heroism by implying
          that anyone can be a hero if they show enough courage and love.
          Additionally, the hero of <i>Strangers</i>, Cole, faces problems
          related to his trauma and can be seen as weak because of his constant
          panic attacks. Yet, by showing that Cole is able to grapple with his
          problems and progress in his relationships, Cole is a hero. Even
          though Cole has superhuman powers, his more important trauma problems
          stop him from making any significant action. Cole’s only real actions
          come from his courage to come back and reunite with his community.
          Breaking from the traditional view of heroism, <i>Strangers</i> shows
          that heroism is not given, as in strength, but earned.
        </p>
        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout <i>Strangers</i>, Cole faces criticism and accusations of
          murder from his community, who believes that he has abandoned them.
          These attacks on Cole obviously do more harm than good, and at times
          hinder his work. Cole, who is already facing issues related to trauma,
          struggles with these attacks, but seeks comfort in other members of
          the Wounded Sky community, including Elder Mariam and his friends. His
          community is angry at him for his abandonment, and this strays away
          from reuniting after the traumatic fire. For example, when Cole tries
          to save the Chief at the hockey rink near the beginning of the novel,
          verbal attacks on him cause him to have a panic attack, despite him
          trying to help. Robertson’s examples of a toxic community that does
          more harm than good when hurtful shows that to truly reconcile and
          unite, a community must come together and support each other. This
          theme is also prevalent in the real Indigenous world, where
          communities are in the process of reconciliation from the effects of
          Residential schools. In giving a fictional depiction of a failure to
          unite and blaming others, the novel suggests that the only way to
          reconcile after a tragedy is through unity and hope.

        <h2>Motifs</h2>
        <p>
          <i
            >A motif is an idea, object, or concept that repeats itself
            throughout a text.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Cole’s panic attacks and visions recur throughout the book and serve
          several purposes. In the beginning of the book, Cole’s panic attacks
          inform the reader of Cole’s past and his troubles with trauma. The
          panic attacks show the reader that something has happened to Cole in
          the past. Initially vague, Cole’s visions become more and more
          complex, long, and informative. Serving a purely foreshadowing purpose
          at the beginning of the book, Cole’s panic attacks start to inform the
          reader of the event that caused Cole’s trauma in the first place.
          Eventually, Cole’s panic attacks evolve into visions that comfort him.
          Cole’s visions are ambiguous at first, but in all cases, Cole’s
          visions serve both informative and foreshadowing purposes. The
          progression of his visions also is a clear indicator of Cole’s growth
          as a character and his strength in battling his trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sudden deaths starting after Cole’s arrival in Wounded Sky are
          coincidentally linked to Cole every time a character dies. In this
          sense, death is a strong motif in the novel. As Cole is surrounded by
          death, he progresses and becomes stronger through all of the tragedy.
          The development of the novel is also characterized by death; numerous
          details in the plot are driven by it. In the beginning, Ashley’s
          sudden and bloody death signals to Cole that he has a mission to
          accomplish and sets him on a journey to find Ashley’s killer. Chief
          Crate and Alex’s deaths indicate that Ashley’s death was not a one-off
          event, and that Cole must find the killer at all costs. Finally,
          Maggie’s death is linked with Cole finding the mysterious files
          containing the names of those who died. All of these events are
          recurring examples of death in the novel, which both drives the plot
          forward and pushes Cole to his limits.
        </p>
        <h2>Point of View</h2>
        <p>
          <i>Strangers</i> features an unusual combination of points of view.
          The novel uses a third-person limited point of view to show the reader
          the inner thoughts and feelings of the main character, Cole Harper. It
          does not reveal the thoughts or inner monologue of the other
          characters; in this sense, it clearly portrays Cole as the main
          character and protagonist. Robertson uses a third-person narration,
          referring to Cole as “he”, instead of first-person narration, which
          would refer to Cole as “I”; Robertson describes Cole’s thoughts and
          feelings while also commenting on them. For example, on page 160, the
          narrator describes Cole running through the forest while also
          commenting on his luck, “No help from the heavens.” Despite this
          narration style, the point of view is complicated by adding the
          omnipresent Choch to the mix. Choch frequently interjects at certain
          places to clarify things, which could imply that while the narrator is
          describing the story, Choch is “standing over their shoulder.” This
          unusual mix of an ordinary narration style and an omnipresent
          character who is also part of the narration makes for an interesting
          storytelling style. In this way, Choch’s interjections serve as a
          clarification for the reader about Indigenous elements while avoiding
          footnotes and making the narration more interesting.
        </p>
        <h2>Style</h2>
        <p>
          <i>Strangers</i> blends dramatic and lyrical descriptions of nature
          and Cole’s surroundings with vivid action and lengthy conversations.
          This creates a style that both evokes a feeling of sympathy with Cole
          and attempts to fully describe Cole’s trauma. At the beginning of the
          novel on page 27, Cole has a panic attack whilst entering Wounded Sky.
          The author uses dramatic, sweeping, but generic terms to describe his
          vision: “He heard the screams of children… Flames roared, thunderous
          and terrible… He saw everything around him - the grass, the trees, the
          path to the school - painted in yellow and orange and red.” This sort
          of lyrical and dramatic descriptions of nature, especially Cole’s
          trauma, continue throughout the book. The dramatic and dark
          descriptions, especially when Cole enters his own community, gives the
          reader a sense that although Cole has agreed to come home, the ominous
          tone implies dark events to follow. Throughout the rest of the book,
          Robertson uses a plain style emphasizing Cole and his emotions. For
          example, Ashley’s death is described in gruesome, horrifying terms,
          evoking Cole’s own emotions. Contrasting Robertson’s lush and vivid
          descriptions of events Cole faces, his style in describing the many
          conversations is plain and keeps the rest of the characters at an
          arm’s length away from the reader. In doing so, Cole becomes the focal
          point of the reader’s emotions. While the rest of the characters are
          angry at Cole for abandoning his community, the reader only has seen
          Cole’s own feelings and is inclined to sympathize with Cole.
          Robertson’s style in the novel is both lush and plain, but in both
          cases, they emphasize Cole and his emotions.
