        <h2>Trauma</h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          The main theme of <i>Strangers</i> - the effects of trauma, especially
          on young people - is expressed through the story’s protagonist, Cole
          Harper. Cole is a young adult whose past is marked by death and guilt
          arising from a fire that burned through a school in his Indigenous
          settlement, Wounded Sky. He is a protagonist whom David A. Robertson
          suggests is a hero because of his courage and determination to do
          justice to his past and reunite his community, despite his
          vulnerabilities about his trauma. It is easy to see that Cole’s
          greatest challenge is his trauma surrounding his community, whom he
          has panic attacks because of. In seeing Cole reunite his community and
          overcome his trauma through solving new problems and interacting with
          figures arising from his trauma - Jayne, Alex, and his friends -
          Robertson is suggesting that trauma is a challenge that can be
          overcome and reckoned with. Despite this, Cole’s challenges with his
          trauma continue throughout the book and will most likely be concluded
          at the end of the series. In <i>Strangers</i>, however, it is evident
          that Cole is coming to terms with his challenges with trauma. By
          showing Cole’s progression, the novel shows that overcoming trauma is
          a process that requires reuniting and deliberate action, as we see in
          Cole.
        </p>
        <h2>Heroism</h2>
        <p>
          In literature, a hero traditionally has been considered to be someone
          possessing great courage or strength. Yet, in <i>Strangers</i>, these
          qualities are hard to describe in Cole Harper. Cole is an
          untraditional hero whose moral courage, love for his community, and
          desire to help the greater good, all make him a hero, Robertson
          suggests. In other words, the heroism of Cole Harper lies not in his
          concrete actions, but in his love and character. Cole’s decision to
          keep going even after being harassed by his critics shows his
          determination and resilience, a quality not often seen in heroes as
          heroes are generally well perceived by the public. In showing that
          Cole is disliked by many, the novel comments on heroism by implying
          that anyone can be a hero if they show enough courage and love.
          Additionally, the hero of <i>Strangers</i>, Cole, faces problems
          related to his trauma and can be seen as weak because of his constant
          panic attacks. Yet, by showing that Cole is able to grapple with his
          problems and progress in his relationships, Cole is a hero. Even
          though Cole has superhuman powers, his more important trauma problems
          stop him from making any significant action. Cole’s only real actions
          come from his courage to come back and reunite with his community.
          Breaking from the traditional view of heroism, <i>Strangers</i> shows
          that heroism is not given, as in strength, but earned.
        </p>
        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout <i>Strangers</i>, Cole faces criticism and accusations of
          murder from his community, who believes that he has abandoned them.
          These attacks on Cole obviously do more harm than good, and at times
          hinder his work. Cole, who is already facing issues related to trauma,
          struggles with these attacks, but seeks comfort in other members of
          the Wounded Sky community, including Elder Mariam and his friends. His
          community is angry at him for his abandonment, and this strays away
          from reuniting after the traumatic fire. For example, when Cole tries
          to save the Chief at the hockey rink near the beginning of the novel,
          verbal attacks on him cause him to have a panic attack, despite him
          trying to help. Robertson’s examples of a toxic community that does
          more harm than good when hurtful shows that to truly reconcile and
          unite, a community must come together and support each other. This
          theme is also prevalent in the real Indigenous world, where
          communities are in the process of reconciliation from the effects of
          Residential schools. In giving a fictional depiction of a failure to
          unite and blaming others, the novel suggests that the only way to
          reconcile after a tragedy is through unity and hope.
